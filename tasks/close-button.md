I would like to add a "drawer" for cancelling fixtures.
.
. All it has to do for now is enable the "Cancel match" button and show a dialog box similar to the other dialog boxes.
.
. For reference I've added a the postpone drawer.
.
. For now:
.
.     - Enable the button
.     - Show an ok button which simply closes the form
