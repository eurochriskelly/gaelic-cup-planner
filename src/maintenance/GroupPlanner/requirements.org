I want to design a function or class in javascript for organizing tournaments and filtering players into groups.

The requirements are as follows:

- I have a set of teams in a category. 
  e.g. 4, 6 or, maybe 13 teams. It varies and could be higher or lower

- I'd like to be able to auto group the teams. e.g. for 13 teams maybe I have 1 group of 5 and 2 groups of 4. 
  For 6 teams I have 2 groups of 3. For 4 teams I have 1 group of 4.

- I'd like to be able to speciy the optimal group size

- I'd like to be able to specify the maximum group size

- Each team in the group should play each other group.
  So a group with 4 teams should each get 3 matches in the group stage
  
- One team must provide umpires while other teams are playing.
  This should be auto-calculated

- Some internal knowledge may be used to put teams with each other so overrides must be possible
  e.g. sometimes 2 teams are much stronger than the others and should not be in the same group as each other

- If only the teams are provided, it should calculated a list of fixtures for the group stage in order

- A team which just played should avoid playing immediately again if possible

- The fixtures should be randomised so that the same teams don't always play each other first

- After the group stage, there is a knockout stage. The top 2 teams of each group should participate in the knockout stage
  - If there are not enough teams to make a power of 2, then the best 3rd place teams should be added to the knockout stage

- The knockout stage should be provided in a calculated order
  e.g. if there are 8 teams from 3 groups, it could go like this:

  - Winner of Group A vs 3rd place team group B (umpired by 2nd place team group C)
  - Winner of Group B vs 3rd place group A (umpired by 2nd place group A)
  - Winner of Group C vs 2rd place group A (umpired by 1st place group A)
  - 2nd place of Group A vs 2nd place of Group B
  etc.


Typical usage will be:

generateFixtures(teams, optimalgroupSize, maxGroupSize, overrides)

and it should generate an array as follows:

{
    groups: {
        A: ["Team A", "Team B", "Team C"],
        B: ["Team I", "Team J", "Team K"],
    },
    fixtures: [
    {
        team1: "Team A",
        team2: "Team B",
        umpire: "Team C"
        stage: "group"
    },
    ... etc. ...,
    {
        team1: "Group[A]/Rank[1]",
        team2: "Group[B]/Rank[3]",
        umpire: "Group[C]/Rank[2]"
        stage: "knockout"
    }
]
}
